#Quickly setup framework using NPM & Bower

##Customizations
The package.json and bower.json files contain dependencies to setup a project using Grunt, SASS, LibSASS, Autoprefixer, Susy, and Breakpoint. To install all these dependencies run <code>npm install</code> on the command line then run <code>bower install</code>. You can go through these files to add or remove dependencies as you see fit but make sure to do this before you install with NPM and Bower just to make it easier on yourself.
